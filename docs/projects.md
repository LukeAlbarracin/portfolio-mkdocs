# Projects

These are my projects. They highlight my experience with both 
object-oriented programming (OOP) and functional programming (FP) paradigms. 

They also demonstrate my full-stack experience with Python, Java, Clojure, or Rust. 

* [Full-Stack Clojure Web App with Python Interpreter](projects/snofin.md)
    * My experimention with a frontend written in Clojure integrated with a backend Python interpreter
* [Full-Stack Android/Java App (OOP) with Natural Language Processing (NLP)](quizmain.md)
    * A Quizlet inspired flashcard application which uses NLP to generate questions
* [Console App (FP) for 2048 game](projects/x2048.md)
    * My first Clojure app using functional programming then later improved using macros
* [Rust macro exploration of tail-call optimization](projects/tailcall.md)
    * A deeper exploration into macros, ASTs, and token parsing in Rust
* [Developer Automation Tool for Clojure](projects/gist.md)
    * Shell command tools to automate installation of Clojure compiler
