Philosophy Major + Computer Science Minor

There is an underrated intersection between philosophy and computer science. 

Computer science is well-acclaimed in today's society, but not so much philosophy - a subject 
that in ancient times was incredibly well respected. After all, philosophy is mostly known
nowadays for dealing in the theoretical, sometimes to an idealistic degree. So to put them
together at first glance can seem downright unusual. However, when comparing the skillset
and subject crossovers, one can be left wondering how such a clear parallel goes unnoticed.

Philosophers are often self-selecting, choosing the subject as their curiosity for understanding
or at least trying to understand the world around them is fascinating. They constantly
question old and new philosophers' arguments, and even their own. In order to prove their arguments,
validate or refute others, or even just to understand arguments, they learn to break down an argument
down to its most essential forms. And with these forms, they know each have a relation with one another,
and that even one bad relation or form can invalidate a whole argument.

One can only imagine when Philosophers carry this desire to understand and explore the unknown into the realm of
computer science, whether it be an area as broad and confusing artificial intelligence or something as specific
as a micro-framework. 


 Each of these forms
 arguments as 
abstract structures, that each part of the argument has some sort of connection and that weak
connections form weak arguments. 


 Yet when applying the curiosity,
eagerness to learn, and ability to recognize argumentative structures, it's hard not to
see how the
